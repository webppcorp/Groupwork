# Introduction
    Groupwork is a practice repository created specifically for improving our understanding of each other coding practices.
    The main goal is to get familiar with how a real project is done through git and github and how to solve the inevitable
    problems arising in the process. What we program in this repository is not important. So dont't get bogged down in details.
    Included in this README is guidelines on how to do things. Please make sure you study them thoroughly and use specification provided
    for a clean and neat working environment.
    GOOD LUCK !!!!!

## Guidelines

### General
  1. Comment if it is necessary and only to describe part of code that you think others won't understanding. <Behnam>
  2. Avoid multiple commit like a plague!!! (Seriously Three commit for blank pages!!!). <Behnam>
  3. I used https://colorhunt.co/palette/212984 as color palette. If you want to changed it make sure you apply appropriate changes in css. <Behnam>

### CSS
  1. Keep all tag selectors in the specified area for easy navigation. <Behnam>
  2. Avoid using classes with arbitrary names. <Behnam>
  3. If possible don't use more than one class for a tag. <Behnam>
  4. Write you CSS code in a descending order corresponding to html page. <Behnam>

### Makhsose sina
  1. Ba in vaze css neveshtane to sakht betenem site benvisem baba
  2. mardak be man migi copy kardi !!! raft codaro az w3school vardashti nakardi inline css dorost koni


## Last Word
    I intended for this guide to be a place we comment on each others programming habits. As you work on this, write your own opinion
    so we better understand each other mindsets. Don't Delete any of the notes i wrote, only add to them with the same format.
    Thank You !!!
